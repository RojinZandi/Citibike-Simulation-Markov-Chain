# Citibike-Simulation-Markov-Chain
In This project we aimed to find the Steady state of number of available bikes in the most crowded NYC Citybike station in July 2021, using Markov Chains.
The Code is implemented in Python and the dataset can be found on https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html
We divided each day to two blocks of time, and worked on the weekdays, because the pattern on weekends are different and we will have another chain.
